Notes

“What You Love the Most About Me Is How Much I Remember About You.”

Remembering more of what colleagues, friends, and acquaintances share with you is about to become your secret weapon. Contact Mapping makes it as simple as pulling your phone out of your pocket.

Contact Mapping is built on top of your most valuable (and abused!) asset -- your address book. Whether it’s the first conversation or the five hundredth, you should map it with a Note. 

After each interaction, simply create a Note for that contact and start talking (or typing, if that’s more your speed). You can use Notes any way you like. Remember names of significant others and children. Jot down a few details about that big meeting they are worried about. Refer back to their hometown, their hobbies, that dream vacation.

Each one of those details becomes a touchpoint for future conversation, and a point for cross reference as you become a Superconnector within your sphere of influence.

As Zig Ziglar famously put it, “You can have everything in life you want if you will just help enough other people get what they want.” The more touchpoints you have on a contact, the better your ability to serve them and others!
